    <h3>Delay</h3>
    <p class="left max">More often than not, this is probably going to be Doug making annoucements.</p>
    <p class="left max">Who knows what sorts of things I will want to say in the future. For now, I want to apologize for the delay in the 2023 results. They are on the YouTube channel, but I haven't had time to get them in to the website.</p>
    <h3>CC Music Hall of Fame</h3>
    <p class="left max">Now, for more exciting news. We are going to start a CC Music Hall of Fame!</p>
    <p class="left max">We have made some changes to the CC CMA to allow time for this. For now, we will leave it at this since the awards still need to be updated on the site.</p>
