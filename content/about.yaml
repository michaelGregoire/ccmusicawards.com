    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>

    <div class="left max">
      <p>Founded in 2017, the Creative Commons Community Music Awards aim to be the Grammys of the creative commons world. They seek to distinguish preeminent musical works that incorporate copyleft licenses and veer from the traditional copyright structure. The CCCMAs set the stage for artists that choose to embrace a shared culture, something unique to the current landscape of music award programs.</p>

      <p>The awards are currently juried by a collection of creative commons artists and compatriots involved in said scene. In its primary years, the CCCMAs recognized musicians via genre, but have since expanded to include region-specific talent in effort to highlight free culture across the globe.</p>

      <p>Awards are bestowed annually, with nomination windows running from January 1st through December 31st of the given year.</p>

        <strong>Utilized:</strong><br />
        A points system that scores community stats that specifically denote a positive community reaction: a point is awarded for individual action items such as favorites on the FMA, hearts on Jamendo, and supporters on Bandcamp. The nominee with the most points is declared winner. (This method was used after multiple calls for votes, for two categories that received no votes)
