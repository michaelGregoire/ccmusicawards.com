    <p class="left max">Who knows what sorts of things I (Doug Whitfield) will want to say in the future. For now, I want to apologize for the delay in the 2023 results. They are on the YouTube channel, but I haven't had time to get them in to the website. The year started off fostering a pit bull. He's a good dog, but he was not a good match for our dog. They got along great, but they fed off of each other's energy in a way that teenage boys often do. Their collective IQ is lower when they are together. It was a challenging start to the year. On top of that, this winter was exceedingly brutal, even by Minnesota standards. Then my sister-in-law and her family moved in. Now, within the span of a couple of months I have been to the ER twice. I am a season ticket holder to Minneapolis City SC. I didn't attend a single game this year. It has been that sort of year. With Netlabel Day festivities now in our rearview mirror, I hope to be able to get the winners up on the website.</p>
